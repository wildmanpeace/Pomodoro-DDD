# Pomodoro-DDD
Want to learn DDD by doing it.  
I like using the Pomodoro method to help me focus and stay on task.  
Figured this would be a simple and great thing to learn DDD and other technologies like Blazor, MAUI, maybe even make it a Flutter App.

Right now working on creating a little CLI project in dotnet.  It will just have a timer and you can edit the default settings.

Probably start working on making a Blazor Web Assembly next.  Maybe even deploy it :). I also want to include having a to-do list to go along with the Pomodoros.
Another feature that I would love to add is the ability to add Strikes to Pomodoros. Ideally in Pomodoro you are working a specific task for 25 mins and then a 5 min break.  
I want the  ability add a strike whenever I get distracted.  I want to classify these strikes and maybe give a little explaination as to why I got distracted.  
At the end of day I would like to have these the strikes grouped together by classification that way I can make plans to overcome these distractions
